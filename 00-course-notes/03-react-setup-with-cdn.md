# React Setup with CDN
* Instead of using the create React app package which creates a full React project which basically means React controls the flow of the whole application with a Webpack setup we can use CDN Links
* CDN setup is good when you only want to create widgets or control small sections of a webpage
* First React CDN Link is the core React library
* Second React CDN Link is for the React DOM library which is a glue layer between React and the DOM
